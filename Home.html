                    <article id="aboutme2">  
                        <p>I am currently a Junior at New York City College of Technology. My major is Computer Systems Technology but my main focus is Web Development.
                        I am more interested in coding/programming than IT support. I've always had a love for technology since I was a kid. When there was a problem at home
                        with the cable box, I'd just play around with it until it's fixed. My love for technology then grew when I was in a robotics class in high school. That's
                        the class I enjoyed most! My robotics teacher recommended I go into engineer in college, fearing the difficulty, I settled for programming. </p>

                        <p>Although I am an extremely shy, independent, and socially awkward woman, I will break out of my shell if I have to. As you can see in the image, I can be
                        a goof-ball. I'm a caring indivdual that has a passion for technology. I'd say I'm a creative person when it comes to designing. </p>
